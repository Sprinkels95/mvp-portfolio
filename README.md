# ðŸ§  Elsbethâ€™s MVP Portfolio

This repo highlights small-but-functional tools I've built to solve real developer and security problems. Each project is scoped as an MVP â€” focused, quick to build, and designed to test ideas.

## Projects

- **[SecureFront](./securefront/README.md)**  
  A browser-based frontend vulnerability scanner with local-only code analysis. Built to catch OWASP Top 10 issues without uploading code.

I'm a technical instructional designer transitioning into more hands-on engineering and AI-integrated tooling. I build tools that solve real problems with clarity, speed, and privacy in mind.
