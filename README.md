# ðŸ§  Elsbethâ€™s MVP Portfolio

This repo highlights small-but-functional tools I've built to solve real developer and security problems. Each project is scoped as an MVP â€” focused, quick to build, and designed to test ideas.

### âœ¨ My Philosophy
My work focuses on both building practical software solutions and creating educational experiences that empower developers. Whether I'm coding a security scanner or designing a workshop, my goal is to make complex topics accessible and actionable.

## ðŸš€ Projects

- **[SecureFront](./securefront/README.md)**  
  A browser-based frontend vulnerability scanner with local-only code analysis. I designed and built this tool from scratch to solve the problem of developer-centric security.

- **[AI for Software Engineers Workshop](./ai-for-se-workshop/README.md)**  
  A workshop exploring how AI tools can transform software engineering workflows. As the curriculum designer, I structured the content and hands-on exercises to take developers from basic prompting to advanced AI-assisted workflows.
