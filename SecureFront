# SecureFront ðŸ”’  
*A front-end vulnerability scanner for "vibe coders"*  

## Overview  
SecureFront is a lightweight, browser-based security analysis tool built to help front-end developers identify common vulnerabilities **before** shipping code. It focuses on accessibility, speed, and privacy â€” running analysis locally in the browser without requiring server uploads.  

Originally developed as a personal project, SecureFront is now evolving into a broader open-source initiative to make **security-first coding approachable for beginners**.  

## Features  
- âœ… Detects common front-end security issues (XSS, hardcoded secrets, unsafe regex, etc.)  
- âœ… Local-only analysis (no cloud uploads, no logging)  
- âœ… Beginner-friendly feedback with remediation tips  
- âœ… AI-assisted mode (via Google Gemini) for repair suggestions  
- âœ… UX-focused interface designed for accessibility  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind  
- **Analysis Engine:** Custom static checks + Gemini API integration  
- **Deployment:** Browser-based app (future: cloud option with cost controls)  

## Demo  
ðŸ‘‰ [Live Demo](#) (coming soon)  

## Roadmap  
- [ ] Expand vulnerability database  
- [ ] Add linting plugin support  
- [ ] Introduce CLI version  
- [ ] Community templates for common frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js)  

## Why It Matters  
Frontend coders often skip security tools because theyâ€™re intimidating or hidden behind enterprise paywalls. SecureFront brings **security into the flow of creativity**, making it a natural part of vibe coding.
